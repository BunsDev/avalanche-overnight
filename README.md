# 🏛 Avalanche Overnight

In most countries around the world, central banks require minimum reserves from banks and financial institutions. The reason for this is simple:

**1. Prevent excessive leverage:** By requiring banks to keep a portion of their deposits at the Central Bank, it limits the amount of money they can lend. This helps avoid excessive financial leverage and reduces the risk of financial crises.

**2. Control of Monetary Liquidity:** Compulsory deposits are a way of regulating the amount of money in circulation. By changing the compulsory deposit rate, the Central Bank can influence the volume of credit available in the economy, which impacts inflation and economic growth.

However, when banks do not have sufficient liquidity to meet reserve requirements, they often resort to interbank credit operations. These operations generally involve the use of low-risk assets, such as Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds), as collateral. In the US federal funds market, banks lend and borrow from each other in overnight transactions to manage their reserves. The interest rate on these transactions is the Federal Funds Rate. Furthermore, in the Repo Market, participants use high-quality securities, such as T-Bills and T-Bonds, as collateral in short-term agreements, usually overnight.

These operations move trillions of dollars every week in dozens of countries around the world. Below are the data operated by some countries:

- **USA (FED):** as of June 2022, the total reserve liabilities of all depository institutions amounted to $20 trillion. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/01/2022-26065/reserve-requirements-of-depository-institutions)

- **Brazil (Central Bank of Brazil):** more than 1.6 trillion BRL (~320 billion dollars) transacted every month.
